### ✨HarmonyOS "One-Develop-Multi-Deploy" Treasure Guide: Official Cases Unleashed! ✨  

Hello everyone! I’m an anonymous coder who just survived the HarmonyOS development trenches, and today I have a major discovery—HarmonyOS official team has long prepared tons of practical cases! Especially for the dreaded "develop once, deploy everywhere" challenge, they’ve sneakily packed so many battle-tested tricks! (Facepalm moment)  


### 🚀 Let’s Dive into the Hardcore Case: Multi-Device Magic for IM Apps 🚀  
The official instant messaging case is pure gold, solving three critical pain points:  
1. How to elegantly switch layouts between mobile/foldable unfolded states?  
2. How to implement columnar interactions on tablets/PCs?  
3. How to adapt the same code to different screen sizes?  

👉 **Battle Trick 1: Navigation Component Deification**  
Check out this soul code:  
```typescript  
// Key layout code  
Navigation(this.pageInfo) {  
  if (this.currentPageIndex === 0) {  
    // Chat list layout  
  } else if (this.currentPageIndex === 1) {  
    // Contact list layout  
  }  
}  
.mode(this.currentBreakpoint === 'sm'  
      ? NavigationMode.Stack  
      : NavigationMode.Split)  
```  
**Key takeaway!** The `mode` attribute is the key to switching between single-column on mobile and dual-column on tablets. It uses stack mode for small screens (`sm`) and auto-switches to split mode for large screens—pure intelligence!  

👉 **Battle Trick 2: Breakpoint Adaptive Black Technology**  
See this device size judgment:  
```typescript  
// Component size adaptation  
.width(Adaptive.HomeTabWidth(this.currentBreakpoint))  
.height(Adaptive.HomeTabHeight(this.currentBreakpoint))  
```  
The official `adaptive.ts` predefines size parameters for each breakpoint (sm/md/lg/xl)—no more writing endless media queries!  


### 🔥 More Hidden Cases Unveiled 🔥  
#### 1️⃣ Cross-Device File Transfer Easter Egg:  
```typescript  
// File preview component  
FilePreview({  
  fileType: detectFileType(file),  
  previewMode: this.currentBreakpoint === 'sm'  
               ? 'vertical' : 'horizontal'  
})  
```  
Vertical preview on mobile, auto-switch to horizontal on tablets—even gesture operations adapt automatically!  

#### 2️⃣ Dynamic Layout Reconstruction:  
```typescript  
// Chat input box layout  
Flex({ direction: this.isLandscape  
             ? FlexDirection.Row  
             : FlexDirection.Column })  
```  
Auto-reorganizes layout for portrait/landscape; input box transforms into a sidebar when foldables unfold—10/10 operation!  


### 💡 Pitfall Prevention Guide:  
● When managing routing stacks with `NavPathStack`, manually call `clear()` when pages are destroyed.  
● Foldable adaptation requires listening to both `foldStatus` and `breakpoint`.  
● PC adaptation notes: Distinguish between mouse hover states and touch feedback.  


### 🎉 End-of-Article Bonus 🎉  
Practical code snippet:  
```typescript  
// Smart margin settings  
.padding({  
  top: this.currentBreakpoint === 'lg' ? 24 : 12,  
  bottom: deviceInfo.deviceType === '2in1' ? 32 : 16  
})  
```  
This padding setting ensures comfortable visual spacing across devices—bookmark it!
